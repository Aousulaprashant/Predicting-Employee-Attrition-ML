# **Predicting Employee Attrition**  

## **Project Overview**  
Employee attrition is a critical concern for organizations, as high turnover can lead to increased costs and loss of talent. This project aims to predict which employees are likely to leave the company using Machine Learning techniques, helping HR teams take proactive measures to retain valuable employees.  

## **Live Demo**

## **Tech Stack & Tools Used**  
✅ **Programming Languages**: Python  
✅ **Machine Learning Library**: scikit-learn  
✅ **Algorithms Used**:**SVM Classifier (Support Vector Machine)**: A powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification.   
✅ **Framework**: **Streamlit** – Used for building an interactive web application.  
✅ **Development Environment**: **Anaconda** – Managed dependencies and environments efficiently.  
✅ **Deployment**: **Streamlit Cloud** – Hosted the application online for easy access.  
✅ **Version Control**: Git & GitHub – Managed project updates and collaboration.  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset used in this project is the **HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists** dataset from Kaggle.  
📌 **Dataset Link**: [HR Analytics Job Change Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists)  
The **HR Analytics Dataset** contains various employee-related features that can influence attrition, including:  
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Education Level  
- **Job-related factors**: Job Role, Department, Tenure  
- **Work environment**: Overtime, Travel Frequency, Work-Life Balance  
- **Compensation**: Salary, Bonuses, Promotions  
- **Performance & Satisfaction**: Job Satisfaction, Training Hours, Performance Rating  

## **Implementation Details**  
All **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and fine-tuning** are implemented in the Jupyter Notebook file:  
📂 **File**: `predicting_Employee_Attrition.ipynb`  
This file contains:  
✔️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
✔️ Feature Selection & Engineering  
✔️ Model Training (SVM)  
✔️ Model Evaluation Metrics  
✔️ Hyperparameter Tuning  

## **Skills Acquired**  
✔ **Machine Learning** – Implementing classification models (SVM)  
✔ **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical data  
✔ **Model Deployment** – Deploying ML models using **Streamlit**  
✔ **Python & Libraries** – Using pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Streamlit for building applications  
✔ **Version Control & Collaboration** – Managing code with **Git & GitHub**  

## **Objective**  
The primary goal is to build a predictive model that can:  
✅ Identify key factors leading to employee attrition  
✅ Provide HR teams with insights into employee retention  
✅ Help companies reduce turnover and improve workplace satisfaction  

## **Expected Outcomes**  
- A machine learning model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company.  
- Insights into the most influential factors affecting employee attrition.  
- Visualizations showcasing trends and patterns in employee turnover.
