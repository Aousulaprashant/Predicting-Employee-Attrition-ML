# **Predicting Employee Attrition**  

## **Project Overview**  
Employee attrition is a critical concern for organizations, as high turnover can lead to increased costs and loss of talent. This project aims to predict which employees are likely to leave the company using Machine Learning techniques, helping HR teams take proactive measures to retain valuable employees.  

## **Techniques Used**  
- **Random Forest**: A powerful ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their outputs for accurate predictions. It is robust against overfitting and works well with tabular data.  
- **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**: An advanced boosting algorithm known for its high performance and efficiency in classification tasks. It helps capture complex relationships in the data and improves predictive accuracy.  

## **Dataset**  
The **HR Analytics Dataset** contains various employee-related features that can influence attrition, including:  
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Education Level  
- **Job-related factors**: Job Role, Department, Tenure  
- **Work environment**: Overtime, Travel Frequency, Work-Life Balance  
- **Compensation**: Salary, Bonuses, Promotions  
- **Performance & Satisfaction**: Job Satisfaction, Training Hours, Performance Rating  

## **Objective**  
The primary goal is to build a predictive model that can:  
✅ Identify key factors leading to employee attrition  
✅ Provide HR teams with insights into employee retention  
✅ Help companies reduce turnover and improve workplace satisfaction  

## **Expected Outcomes**  
- A machine learning model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company.  
- Insights into the most influential factors affecting employee attrition.  
- Visualizations showcasing trends and patterns in employee turnover.
